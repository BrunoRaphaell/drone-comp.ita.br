The article "Autonomous and Collective Intelligence for UAV Swarm in Target
Search Scenario" has been accepted for the [IEEE LARS/SBR
2021](http://www.natalnet.br/lars-sbr2021/) (Latin American Robotics
Symposium/Brazilian Robotics Symposium).

The paper addresses the application of a swarm of drones with autonomous
intelligence in a search scenario for unknown targets. The swarm of UAVs applies
AI techniques to obtain autonomous and distributed intelligence for
cooperative search. Results showed an improvement in the efficiency of the
swarm when applying distributed decision-making heuristics.

The article was one of the results obtained by students of the course
*Simulation of Drones and Applications (SC-249)* of the Graduate Program on
[Electronics and Computer Engineering](http://www.ita.br/posgrad/pgeecen) at
the Aeronautics Institute of Technology.
