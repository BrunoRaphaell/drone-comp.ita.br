Our research group infrastructure has been
[registered](https://pnipe.mctic.gov.br/laboratory/6413) in the
[National Research Infrastructure Platform (PNIPE)](https://pnipe.mctic.gov.br/).

The registration further promotes the collaboration of the group with other
Brazilian laboratories.

## More about PNIPE

The PNIPE aims to systematically map and gather information on research
infrastructures in Scientific, Technological and Innovation Institutions (STIs)
in Brazil, enabling access for the scientific and technological community and
companies to existing laboratory facilities and research equipment, promoting
their shared use.

PNIPE intends to:

- Provide the scientific and technological community access to information on
  existing research infrastructures, including their location, applications and
  conditions of use;
- Foster the research infrastructureâ€™s potential of innovation by giving
  visibility and insights for companies to cooperatively improve their products
  and develop new technologies;
- Encourage the shared use of resources and collaboration between research
  groups from different areas, institutions and regions, consolidating
  collaborations between them;
- Optimize the use of laboratory facilities and scientific research equipment
  to avoid fragmentation and duplicated efforts; and
- Optimize the use of public resources in the preventive and corrective
  maintenance of existing infrastructures, as well as in the creation of new
  facilities and new equipment acquisition.

Examples of research infrastructures are: large research facilities,
laboratories, pilot plants, animal facilities, clean rooms, high-performance
computer networks, databases, collections, observatories, telescopes, research
ships, natural reserves, experimental stations, among others.
