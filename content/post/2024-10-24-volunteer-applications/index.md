The DroneComp Research Group is seeking motivated individuals to join our team
as volunteer researchers. This is an exciting opportunity for those interested
in contributing to cutting-edge developments in artificial intelligence and
machine learning, specifically focused on human-centric evaluation of large
language models (LLMs).

## Position Overview

The selected volunteers will work on the development of an open-source tool
designed for **human-centric evaluation of LLMs** (Large Language Models). This
tool aims to provide active and continuous testing of LLMs based on
human-centered metrics, playing a key role in ensuring the models align with
real-world expectations, fairness, and usability standards.

- [Active Testing: Sample-Efficient Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05331)

## Key Responsibilities

- **Programming and software development**: Contribute to the development of the open-source evaluation tool using appropriate programming languages and frameworks.
- **Collaboration and feedback**: Work alongside experts in AI and machine learning to refine the tool and provide improvements.
- **Documentation**: Create thorough documentation to ensure the evaluation tool can be easily used and expanded by other researchers.

## Requirements

- **Strong programming skills** in Python (knowledge of other languages is a plus).
- Familiarity with **machine learning** and basic **natural language processing** (NLP) concepts.
- Experience with **open-source projects** is preferred.
- **Self-motivated and proactive**: You should be able to work independently and meet deadlines.
- Willingness to collaborate and contribute to a dynamic research environment.

## Benefits of Joining

- **Future Opportunities**: Volunteers will be given priority consideration for **scholarships and grants** as they become available within the group.
- **Learning and growth**: Gain valuable experience in developing and evaluating AI models with a human-centric approach, expanding your research and software development skills.
- **Networking**: Work with professionals and experts in the field, opening doors to future research and career opportunities.
