abstract: Despite the significant advancements in drone sensory device reliability,
  data integrity from these devices remains critical in securing successful flight
  plans. A notable issue is the vulnerability of GNSS to jamming attacks or signal
  loss from satellites, potentially leading to incomplete drone flight plans. To address
  this, we introduce SiaN-VO, a Siamese neural network designed for visual odometry
  prediction in such challenging scenarios. Our preliminary studies have shown promising
  results, particularly for flights under static conditions (constant speed and altitude);
  while these findings are encouraging, they do not fully represent the complexities
  of real-world flight conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we have furthered our
  research to enhance SiaN-VO, improving data integration from multiple sensors and
  enabling more accurate displacement predictions in dynamic flight conditions, thereby
  marking a significant step forward in drone navigation technology.
