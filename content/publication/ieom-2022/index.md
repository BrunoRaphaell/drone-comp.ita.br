abstract: There are currently large amounts of public databases on COVID-19 patients.
  Among them the FAPESP COVID-19 Data Sharing/BR has gathered laboratory tests and
  hospitalization data from large health centers in the São Paulo metropolitan area.
  This paper uses part of such a repository to assemble a set of networks of positive
  COVID-19 patients according to the similarity of their age and laboratory tests
  results. Next, popular complex network metrics such as clustering coefficient and
  average path length are extracted from such networks and compared to the expected
  values observed for classical networks. Similarities of the clustering coefficient
  values with those of Watts-Strogatz networks were observed, although there are no
  sustainable characteristics of Small World networks. There are also similarities
  to scale-free networks, such as high-degree variance and the presence of hubs of
  nodes. In addition, a partition of the networks based on the modularity measure
  using the Fast Greedy algorithm is obtained and analyzed. An structure with four
  clusters and modularity values greater than zero was found, indicating that the
  network has some community structure.
