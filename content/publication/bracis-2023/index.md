abstract: In clustering problems where the objective is not based on specifically
  spatial proximity, but rather on feature patterns and the semantic description,
  traditional internal cluster validation indices might not be appropriate. This article
  proposes a novel validity index to suggest the most appropriate number of clusters
  based on a semantic description of categorical databases. To assess our index, we
  also propose a synthetic data generator specifically designed for this type of application.
  We tested data sets with different configurations to assess the performance of the
  proposed index compared to well-known indices in the literature. Thus, we demonstrate
  that the index has great potential for discovering the number of clusters for the
  type of application studied and the data generator is able to produce relevant data
  sets for the internal validation process.
